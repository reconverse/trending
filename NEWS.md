# trending (development version)

* Fix a bug in `fit.list()` that was causing it to sometimes fail when used
  within other functions.

# trending 0.1.0

## Breaking changes

* Reworking of the output from both fit and predict functions:
    - Warnings and errors are captured for both individual and multiple models.
    - By default, these are returned in tibbles.
    - Fitting warnings/errors are no longer carried over in to the predict output.

# trending 0.0.2
